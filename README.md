LSTM Time Series Prediction
This repository provides an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model setup and a flexible data loading pipeline for time series prediction tasks. It includes data preprocessing, sequence generation, and model training, built using PyTorch/Keras (choose one). The design supports easy adaptation for custom datasets and integration into larger machine learning workflows.

🔧 Features
✅ Preprocessing for raw time series data

✅ Sequence generation for supervised learning

✅ LSTM model architecture setup

✅ Model training & evaluation

✅ Custom dataset integration

✅ PyTorch/Keras (configurable)
